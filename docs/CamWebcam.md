# Web Cam Access

[![Up](img/goup.gif)](./Cam.md)

**raspiCamSrv** enables webcam functionalities with Raspberry Pi cameras.

For Pi 5 with two camera ports, both cameras can be streamed simultaneously.

This page shows the URLS for MJPEG streaming as well as for photo snapshots:

![Webcam](./img/CamWebcam2.jpg)

The left side of the page always shows the active camera.   
If an additional camera is available, video stream and photo are shown on the right side.

When switching the cameras, either with the **Switch Cameras** button in [Multi-Cam](./CamMulticam.md) or by changing the camera in the [Settings](./Settings.md#switching-the-active-camera), the streams will be exchanged.   
The *video_feed* endpoint will always refer to the active camera, which is also shown in the title bar.    
The *video_feed2* endpoint will always refer to the other camera, if available.

The configuration and camera stream used for video and photo capture are indicated.

The links shown on the page open a new browser window.

## Video Stream

The video stream will always use the LIVE configuration.   
By default, this configuration uses the *lores* camera stream.   
The camera stream as well as its *stream size* can be configured in the [Configuration](./Configuration.md) screen.

## Photo Snapshot

The photo snapshot is currently also using the LIVE configuration.
