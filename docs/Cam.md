# Cam - Camera Usage

[![Up](img/goup.gif)](./UserGuide.md)

This menu gives access to the available high-level camera usage scenarios, in particular in the case of multiple non-USB cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi (currently only Pi 5 can connect two cameras).

- The [Web Cam](./CamWebcam.md) dialog demonstrates how to stream video or image from your cameras.
- The [Multi-Cam](./CamMulticam.md) dialog allows controlling both cameras individually or synchronously.     
(This dialog is only available for multi-camera systems)
