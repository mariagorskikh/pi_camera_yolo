![Cam Menu](img/CamMenu.jpg)

This menu gives access to the available high-level camera usage scenarios, in particular in the case of multiple non-USB cameras connected to a Raspberry Pi (currently only Pi 5 can connect two cameras).

- The [Web Cam](./CamWebcam.md) dialog demonstrates how to stream video or image from your cameras.
- The [Multi-Cam](./CamMulticam.md) dialog allows controlling both cameras individually or synchronously.     
(This dialog is only available for multi-camera systems)
- The [Camera Calibration](./CamCalibration.md) dialog can be used for calibration and rectification of stereo cameras.    
(This dialog is only available if *Stereo Vision* is activated in the [Settings](./Settings.md#activating--deactivating-stereo-vision) dialog)
- The [Stereo-Cam](./CamStereo.md) dialog can be used for visualization of depth maps as well as for viewing and recording of 3D videos.      
(This dialog is only available if *Stereo Vision* is activated in the [Settings](./Settings.md#activating--deactivating-stereo-vision))
